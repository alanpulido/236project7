I made the screen bigger.

This program keeps score well.

I added two extra animals that move.

The sound is now 'missed' when the hand hits the air.

There is background music that plays constantly.

For what it's worth, I attempted to make a menu (via a loop) but it's not really working.

My own feature was that when you hit the tiger it crys out and a point is lost for the hit score and the same for the dolphin (I was able to create the sprites, however, the sprites will not interact with the hand.).
