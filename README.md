I made the screen bigger.
5/5

This program keeps score well.
10/10

I added two extra animals that move.
10/10

The sound is now 'missed' when the hand hits the air.
5/5

There is background music that plays constantly.
8/10 or 7/10 (i dont feel i deserve full credit bc the music wont stop on a pause...there is no pause)

For what it's worth, I attempted to make a menu (via a loop) but it's not really working.
1/10 (maybe 1 point for trying?)

My own feature was that when you hit the tiger it crys out and a point is lost for the hit score and the same for the dolphin (I was able to create the sprites, however, the sprites will not interact with the hand.).
10/20 (this IS similar to what the monkey can do but not exactly the same)
